Creating a Chrome extension that captures Google Live Captions output and saves it directly to Notepad involves several steps. Here's a solution for building such an extension.
Overview:

This Chrome extension will capture Google Live Captions from videos (like YouTube or any site using Google Live Captions) and save the captioned text to a local text file (e.g., Notepad) for later reference. The extension will use the chrome.tabs API to access content in the active tab, extract caption text from the page, and allow users to download the captions as a .txt file.
Step 1: Setting Up Your Chrome Extension
1.1 Create the Project Directory

Create a new folder on your system to store all files related to the extension. The folder should contain the following files:

    manifest.json – The configuration file for the extension.
    background.js – The background script that will listen for events and handle the logic.
    popup.html – The HTML file for the popup interface.
    popup.js – The script for handling the logic on the popup.

1.2 manifest.json

This is the metadata file for the Chrome extension. It defines how the extension interacts with the browser.

{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Google Live Captions Saver",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Capture and save Google Live Captions to Notepad.",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage"
  ],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icon16.png",
      "48": "icon48.png",
      "128": "icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}

1.3 background.js

This background script will handle any tasks that need to run in the background, such as monitoring events or managing message passing between the popup and content scripts.

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Live Captions Saver Extension Installed");
});

1.4 popup.html

This file will create the user interface for the popup that appears when the user clicks on the extension icon.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Save Captions</title>
    <style>
      body {
        width: 250px;
        height: 150px;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        padding: 10px;
      }
      button {
        padding: 10px;
        background-color: #4CAF50;
        color: white;
        border: none;
        cursor: pointer;
      }
      button:hover {
        background-color: #45a049;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Google Live Captions Saver</h3>
    <button id="saveCaptions">Save Captions to Notepad</button>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

1.5 popup.js

This script handles the interaction between the popup and the content script. It listens for clicks on the "Save Captions" button and communicates with the content script to retrieve the live captions.

document.getElementById("saveCaptions").addEventListener("click", () => {
  // Send a message to the content script to capture the live captions
  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => {
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, { action: "captureCaptions" }, (response) => {
      if (response && response.captions) {
        saveToNotepad(response.captions);
      } else {
        alert("No captions found.");
      }
    });
  });
});

function saveToNotepad(captions) {
  const blob = new Blob([captions], { type: "text/plain" });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement("a");
  a.href = url;
  a.download = "captions.txt";
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  a.click();
  document.body.removeChild(a);
}

1.6 content.js

The content script will run in the context of the web page and will monitor for live caption data. For simplicity, let's assume the captions are available in a specific DOM element (you may need to customize this depending on how Google Live Captions are implemented).

// Listen for the message from the popup to capture captions
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.action === "captureCaptions") {
    // Here, you will need to extract the live captions from the page
    let captions = "";
    
    // Example for YouTube: captions might be inside a specific DOM element
    const captionElements = document.querySelectorAll('.caption-window span'); // Adjust for correct selector

    if (captionElements) {
      captions = Array.from(captionElements).map(e => e.innerText).join("\n");
      sendResponse({ captions });
    } else {
      sendResponse({ captions: null });
    }
  }
});

Step 2: Packaging and Testing

    Package the Extension:
        Make sure all the files (manifest.json, background.js, popup.html, popup.js, content.js) are in the same directory.
        Create the icons (icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png) to be used in the extension.
        Go to Chrome’s Extensions page (chrome://extensions/) and enable "Developer mode".
        Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you have stored your extension files.

    Testing:
        Once the extension is loaded, navigate to a site with Google Live Captions enabled (e.g., YouTube).
        Click the extension icon and click "Save Captions to Notepad".
        The live captions should be saved as a .txt file that can be opened with Notepad.

Step 3: Handling Edge Cases

    Captions may not be available: You may need to adjust the logic inside the content.js file to handle different ways that live captions can be embedded in a page. You can inspect the page’s HTML to find the correct selectors.
    Support for other platforms: If you want to support other video platforms with captions, you would need to adapt the content.js script to find the correct DOM elements or APIs used by those platforms.

Step 4: Deployment

Once you have successfully tested the extension, you can distribute it:

    Publish it on the Chrome Web Store.
    Share the extension by creating a .zip package and allowing users to install it manually.

Conclusion

This Chrome extension captures Google Live Captions and saves them as a text file for later use. By using the Chrome extension APIs, JavaScript, and a content script to capture the captions, we’ve built a solution that facilitates users who want to save captions for reference.

If you want to extend the functionality, such as saving captions in different formats or adding features like scheduling saves, you can easily do so by modifying the existing code.
